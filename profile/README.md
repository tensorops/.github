# TensorOps :rocket::brain:
TensorOps is a non-profit open-source organization on GitHub focused on developing libraries related to deep learning, with a specific focus on transformers. Our goal is to help researchers, professionals, and enthusiasts develop state-of-the-art models using the latest techniques and algorithms.

## Our Flagship Library :books: :computer:
Our flagship library, <a href="https://github.com/tensorops/TransformerX">TransformerX</a>, is a powerful toolkit for building transformer-based models. With TransformerX, users can easily build and train these models in a range of different contexts.

## Our Community :busts_in_silhouette::earth_americas:
TensorOps has a community of contributors and users who are passionate about advancing the field of deep learning. We welcome all those interested in working with us to help improve these libraries and make cutting-edge tools and techniques accessible to all.

## Join us :handshake::nerd_face:
If you are interested in deep learning, transformers, and open-source development, we invite you to join the TensorOps community and contribute to these libraries. Together, we can push the boundaries of what is possible with deep learning and transformers.
